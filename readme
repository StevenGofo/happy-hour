Hello,

Welcome to my personal project where I am attempting to create an android application for personal use that displays local deals and happy hours at bars near my location.

This will constantly be a work in progress as it is my first solo project, and I'll be attempting to learn how web-scraping works and implementing it into an application for mobile devices.
